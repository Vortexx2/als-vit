# Detection of ASL Signs Using Vision Transformers

# Introduction

- Using Vision Transformers to try and classify ASL alphabets from this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grassknoted/asl-alphabet).

### This repository aims to achieve these tasks:

1. Serve as a beginner's approach to implementing a research paper (_ViT_ in this case).
2. My first experience with operating with large dataset.
3. Implemeting a custom dataset that is a `Dataset` (random access dataset) from a `zipfile` (without unzipping).
4. Using transfer learning to finetune on this application.
